# Heavy I-94 Traffic Indicators

In this project we're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 interstate highway. We'll be using a mixture of exploratory and explanatory data visualizations to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. Some examples that could cause heavier traffic are; weather, time of the day, day of the week, etc.
